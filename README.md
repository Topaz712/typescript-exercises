Exercises to apply TypeScript Fundamentals

## REFLECTION & ENGAGEMENT:


** Reflect on the exercises: What aspects were intuitive? Which parts did you find challenging?**

Most of the exercises seemed to follow the same JavaScript code setup, adding a type to a variable/function/object seemed to be straighforward, Exercise 5 was a little challenging because i forgot to add a boolean type to the isPassing method
so at first i just console logged a string and it conflicted when i tried to test the boolean for the gradeThreshold, finally i looked at similar code snippets to figure out it wasn't working and so i went back and added the boolean type
to the isPassing method and returned what i wanted to test true or false.
